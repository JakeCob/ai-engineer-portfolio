# Customer Support Ticket Classifier Project

## Project Overview
Personal version of supervised fine-tuning project for multi-label text classification, originally developed for email labeling at company. This showcase demonstrates the same skills with publicly available data.

## Dataset Options

### Primary Dataset: Customer Support on Twitter âœ…
- **Source**: Kaggle - "Customer Support on Twitter"
- **Size**: ~3 million tweets
- **Features**: Brand responses, customer queries, conversation threads
- **Link**: [kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter)
- **Companies**: Apple, Amazon, Uber, Delta, Spotify, etc.

### Secondary Datasets (for augmentation):
1. **Banking77**: 13,083 banking queries in 77 intents
2. **CLINC150**: 23,700 queries in 150 intents
3. **Bitext Customer Support**: 27,000 e-commerce support utterances
4. **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**: Technical support conversations

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- [ ] Download Twitter Customer Support dataset from Kaggle
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis
- [ ] Clean and preprocess text data
- [ ] Create train/validation/test splits
- [ ] Handle class imbalance
- [ ] Augment with secondary datasets if needed

### Phase 2: Model Development
- [ ] Select base model (BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT)
- [ ] Implement data loaders and tokenization
- [ ] Design multi-task classification head:
  - Category (Technical, Billing, General, Complaint)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative, Angry)
  - Intent (Specific action needed)
  - Department routing
- [ ] Implement training loop with:
  - Mixed precision training
  - Gradient accumulation
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Early stopping

### Phase 3: Training & Evaluation
- [ ] Fine-tune model on GPU (Colab/Kaggle if needed)
- [ ] Track metrics:
  - Accuracy per class
  - F1 scores (macro/micro)
  - Confusion matrices
  - ROC-AUC curves
- [ ] Perform error analysis
- [ ] Ablation studies on model components
- [ ] Compare against baseline models

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Model quantization/distillation
- [ ] Optimize inference speed
- [ ] Reduce model size for deployment

### Phase 5: Demo Development
- [ ] Create web interface for ticket classification
- [ ] Implement real-time prediction API
- [ ] Add explanation/attention visualization
- [ ] Create batch processing capability
- [ ] Add confidence scores and thresholds

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive project MDX file
- [ ] Document model architecture decisions
- [ ] Create performance comparison charts
- [ ] Write about challenges and solutions
- [ ] Add business impact metrics
- [ ] Include code snippets and examples

### Phase 7: Deployment
- [ ] Containerize model with Docker
- [ ] Deploy API (Hugging Face Spaces/Railway/Vercel)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add to portfolio demos page

## Key Features to Highlight

### Technical Skills
- Supervised fine-tuning of transformer models
- Multi-label and multi-task classification
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Text preprocessing and augmentation
- Model optimization and deployment

### Business Value
- Automated ticket routing (reduce manual work by 80%)
- Priority detection (faster response to urgent issues)
- Sentiment analysis (identify angry customers)
- Department classification (improve team efficiency)
- Intent recognition (better first-response accuracy)

## Unique Differentiators
1. **Multi-task Learning**: Single model handles multiple classification tasks
2. **Real-world Data**: Uses actual customer support conversations
3. **Production-Ready**: Includes deployment and monitoring
4. **Interactive Demo**: Live web interface for testing
5. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed performance analysis

## Expected Outcomes

### Model Performance Targets
- Overall accuracy: >85%
- F1 score (macro): >0.80
