# Building Agent-First Applications: Lessons Learned

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the content system. Replace this with your actual blog content.

## Introduction

The shift toward agent-first application design represents a fundamental change in how we think about software architecture.

## Key Principles

### 1. Context Awareness

Agents must understand:
- User intent and goals
- Current system state  
- Available resources
- Historical patterns

### 2. Tool Integration

```typescript
interface ToolRegistry {
  register(tool: Tool): void;
  execute(toolName: string, params: unknown): Promise<ToolResult>;
}
```

### 3. Error Recovery

Robust agent systems need:
- Graceful degradation
- Fallback strategies  
- User feedback loops
- Learning mechanisms

## Conclusion

Agent-first design requires rethinking traditional patterns but offers significant benefits in user experience and system adaptability.
