## Problem Statement

During Philippine elections, citizens struggle to find accurate, accessible information about candidates and voting processes. Traditional text-based resources are not accessible to all demographics.

## Solution Architecture

Built a production-ready audio AI agent that:

- **Voice Processing**: OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
- **LLM Integration**: GPT-4 for natural language understanding and response generation
- **RAG System**: Custom knowledge base with election information and candidate data
- **Audio Synthesis**: Text-to-speech for natural voice responses
- **API Design**: FastAPI backend with real-time audio streaming

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Core Agent Architecture
class TapatAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.whisper_model = WhisperModel("large-v3")
        self.llm = GPT4ChatCompletion()
        self.vector_store = ChromaVectorStore()
        self.tts_engine = ElevenLabsTTS()

    async def process_audio(self, audio_bytes):
        # Speech-to-text
        transcript = await self.whisper_model.transcribe(audio_bytes)

        # RAG retrieval
        context = await self.vector_store.similarity_search(transcript)

        # LLM response generation
        response = await self.llm.chat_completion(
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {transcript}"}
            ]
        )

        # Text-to-speech
        audio_response = await self.tts_engine.synthesize(response)
        return audio_response
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Audio Processing
- Sub-2 second latency for complete audio-to-audio pipeline
- Streaming audio input/output for natural conversation flow
- Noise filtering and audio quality optimization

### Multilingual Support
- Support for English, Filipino, and regional languages
- Context-aware language detection and response matching
- Cultural sensitivity in political information delivery

### Production Deployment
- Dockerized FastAPI application
- Scalable architecture for high concurrent users
- Monitoring and logging for production reliability

## Results & Impact

- **Response Latency**: Achieved sub-2 second audio-to-audio response time
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy on election information queries
- **Accessibility**: Made political information accessible to diverse user base
- **Scalability**: Handled concurrent users during testing phase

## Technical Stack

- **Audio Processing**: OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs TTS
- **LLM**: GPT-4 with custom prompt engineering
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, AsyncIO
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB for RAG implementation
- **Deployment**: Docker, production-ready architecture
- **Integration**: LangChain for LLM orchestration

This project demonstrates end-to-end AI system design, from audio processing to LLM integration, with focus on real-world production deployment and user accessibility.
