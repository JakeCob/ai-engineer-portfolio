## Implementation Details

### SLAM3R Integration

```python
# Core SLAM3R processing pipeline
class SpatialReconstruction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.slam_model = SLAM3R(config="outdoor_config.yaml")
        self.point_cloud_processor = PointCloudProcessor()
        self.mesh_generator = MeshGenerator()

    def process_video(self, video_path):
        # Extract frames and camera poses
        frames, poses = self.slam_model.process_sequence(video_path)

        # Generate dense point cloud
        point_cloud = self.slam_model.dense_mapping(frames, poses)

        # Create mesh representation
        mesh = self.mesh_generator.poisson_reconstruction(point_cloud)

        # Generate 2D floorplan
        floorplan = self.extract_floorplan(point_cloud, poses)

        return {
            'point_cloud': point_cloud,
            'mesh': mesh,
            'floorplan': floorplan,
