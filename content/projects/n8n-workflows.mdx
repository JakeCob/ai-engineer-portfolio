## About This Project

Enterprise-grade automation platform built with n8n, demonstrating expertise in no-code AI workflow development and system integration. The workflows showcased above include the **live production system** that powers this portfolio's AI assistant, featuring RAG-enhanced responses, conversation memory, and sub-2-second response times.

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive workflow orchestration system using n8n to automate complex business processes, integrate multiple services, and deploy AI-powered solutions without traditional coding approaches. This experience, combined with my current role at Sevron Ltd, showcases practical expertise in enterprise-grade no-code automation platforms.

## Core Components

- **n8n Workflow Engine** - Central orchestration platform for all automations
- **LLM Integration Layer** - Custom nodes for GPT-4, Claude, and local models
- **Database Connectors** - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis integrations
- **API Gateway** - RESTful APIs for external service communication
- **Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time workflow performance tracking

## Key Workflows Implemented

### Customer Support Automation
Achieved 95% automation rate through:
- Ticket classification using NLP
- Auto-routing to appropriate departments
- Response generation with knowledge base RAG
- Escalation triggers for complex issues

### Content Marketing Pipeline
60% efficiency improvement via:
- Keyword research automation
- Content brief generation
- Multi-platform adaptation
- Performance tracking integration

### Sales Process Optimization
Enhanced conversion rates through:
- Lead scoring with ML models
- Personalized outreach sequences
- CRM data synchronization
- Performance analytics dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Sample Workflow Configuration

```javascript
const workflow = {
  nodes: [
    {
      name: "Data Ingestion",
      type: "webhook",
      parameters: {
        httpMethod: "POST",
        path: "/process-document"
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Document Analysis",
      type: "langchain-llm",
      parameters: {
        model: "gpt-4",
        temperature: 0.3,
        prompt: "Analyze this document: {{ $json.content }}"
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Database Update",
      type: "postgres",
      parameters: {
        operation: "insert",
        table: "document_analysis",
        columns: ["content", "insights", "created_at"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
